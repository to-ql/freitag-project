                            FREITAG was created by Marcus Freitag and Daniel Freitag Brothers in
                            Zurich, Switzerland. The two brothers, who were designers, went on bicycles,
                            and on rainy days, we needed a sturdy bag that did not wet the
                            sketch paper. Then a truck goes in front of them and the inspired
                            Marcus goes to a nearby waste truck and returns with an abandoned
                            truck lid, a car seat belt, and an abandoned bicycle wheel. After washing
                            the truck cloth in the bathroom, she starts working with her mother's
                            sewing machine to create the first 'messenger bag'. It was the moment 
                            when things that would have been worn out were reborn as the only
                            bag in the world through the Brotherhood.

                            "Honestly, it was a coincidence that we first used 'recycled products'.
                            When I first made my bag, my house was attached to the highway.
                            Originally, I was going to make a waterproof bag, but I wondered what a
                            sturdy fabric would be like when it was waterproof, and then I looked at
                            the truck running on the highway and thought, 'I can do that.' I could
                            contact fabric suppliers, but I was more desirous to find new materials
                            as a designer. I asked the shipping company if I could get thousands of
                            trucks to dispose of, and I made my first bag with it. The bag was perfect
                            for the functionality we thought it would be. It's hard and waterproof.
                            From the beginning we will only use 'recyclables'. I did not think
                            the same thing. " When I looked for functionality, it was a recycled material
                            that stood out by chance. "
