                        Transforming used truck tarps into highly functional, unique
                        bags takes place in five highly complex stages at the F-actory.
                        FREITAG bags are made from a combination of three raw materials:
                        tarpaulin, which is the lungs of trucks, rubber tubes
                        inside bicycle wheels, and seat belts in cars.

                        It’s hard to believe with the endless columns of trucks out there
                        on the transport routes, but used truck tarps aren’t just lying
                        around on the street. And especially not the really good ones.
                        Sourcing raw materials for FREITAG may not be Glencore but it is
                        definitely hardcore. To ensure that our 200 F-Workers always have
                        something to do and to eat, our five tarp buyers – also known as
                        truck spotters – have to find and bring back approximately 460
                        tons of tarps to Noerd each year. To accomplish this, the truck
                        spotters are on the phone non-stop, or prowling around the truck
                        stops of Europe to hunt down the best tarps in the hottest colors
                        from trucks, truckers and shipping companies.

                            Freeing tarps from their imprisonment as dirty, bulky truck covers
                            so they can be processed further is no walk in the park. We need
                            men like Thomas to turn the gigantic tarp monsters into R.I.P.s
                            (Recycled Individual Products) by first freeing them of eyelets,
                            straps, belts and anything else that a FREITAG bag doesn’t need.
                            With a sharp eye and an even sharper knife, the toughest boys on
                            the F-Crew see the potential of each tarp that lands on their table.
                            They then hack and carve prime cuts from the scruffy beasts and
                            cut them into standardized 7.8-foot pieces, fold them together
                            and send them off to the Laundry Department.

                        What happens in the NOERD cellar has nothing in common with
                        what you do in your laundry room – even though it might look
                        almost the same. Obviously, bags have to be clean. However, the
                        real work that our tarp washers like Mustapha and Salim carry
                        out is to transform “used” into “patina” and “old” into “vintage”
                        using 3963 gallons of rainwater daily along with our secret
                        tarp-wash bath additive. After they have released the inner
                        beauty of the old tarps and dried them, the tarps are bundled according
                        to color and sent to the bag designers.

                        working their fingers to the bone. Lara and her co-designers fashion
                        each individual bag by using their templates and cutters to
                        carve the most beautiful and exquisite designs possible from the
                        tarps and then making sure that the rest of the pieces match as

                        Only prototypes and test bags are sewn at the F-actory. We entrust
                        the sewing of your FREITAG bag to experienced partners in
                        Switzerland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, France, Portugal and Tunisia,
                        who understand how to carefully stitch together tarps that
                        are thicker than leather. As soon as the bags are back at Noerd,
                        we show off our Swiss side and go over the bags with a
                        fine-toothed comb to ensure that everything is in order and then
                        select the products that will end up in a crate together according
                        to the secret FREITAG color scheme. Unique products, which will
                        be sold in the Online Shop, are then put on a pedestal and photographed
                        from all sides.
